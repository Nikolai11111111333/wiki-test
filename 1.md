As [_John Gruber_](http://daringfireball.net/) writes on the [_Markdown site_](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

> _The overriding design goal for Markdown’s\
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable\
> as possible. The idea is that a\
> Markdown-formatted document should be\
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without\
> looking like it’s been marked up with tags\
> or formatting instructions._
